#but is it practical? It means one query per dataSet.
#I guess we may query on dataSets by name using query, but we would need an %in% operator,
#rather than an == operator that forces as many queries as items to retireve,
#alternativelly, we need to fetch them all and filter.
#this needs to be automayted.

#Y veo que contributors tiene mÃ¡s datos :( (Country,  Organization, Url, Email)
#que se podrian pillar recursivamente
